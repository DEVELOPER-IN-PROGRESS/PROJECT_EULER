1) Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

SOln:  we can find the sum using brute force  , but ad inputs get bigger it wont be an 
 efficient algorithm 

 so the efficient way is to use gauss formula for sum of n natural numbers
 s(n) = n(n+1)/2

 here the multiples of 15 are redundant so we subtract it
